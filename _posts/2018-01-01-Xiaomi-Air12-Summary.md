# Introduction

My purchase of [Xiaomi Air 12 laptop from Gearbest](https://www.gearbest.com/laptops/pp_416105.html) arrived recently. Have been checking out this laptop lately.

Started with backing up the licence details, drivers. Converted the Windows to English version. Took a full drive backup image in case I need to use the Windows in future. Then wiped the hard drive and installed Fedora 26 Workstation.

So far, it has been a very smooth Fedora experience on this laptop.
