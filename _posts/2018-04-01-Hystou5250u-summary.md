# Introduction

Having had an Intel NUC in the past, I had been on the lookout for similar small form factor (SFF) computers that would run quiet and be be frugsl on power consumption. I wanted to use it as a Linux (Fedora) server. Intel Atom powered devices are too underpowered for my needs.

I came across these while searching for such mini pcs. These look like white label manufactured units. You'll find identical other branded ones too. Hystou and eGlobal are amongst the retailers that have been around for a while.

The item feels solid. The thick aluminium casing acts as a good heat sink.

* Nice thick aluminium casing acts as a good heatsink. Computer runs cool.
